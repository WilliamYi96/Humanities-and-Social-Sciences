# What makes Psychology Unique?

## Four components of the definition of psychology:
- Scientific
- Bahavior 
- Individual 
- Mental

Psychology is one subject of science, we should not draw a conclusion without doing experiments and scientific analysis methods. 
Meanwhile, our methods will mainly descover the inner world of indivisual reflecting on their behavior. 

## Four goals apply to psychologists who conduct research:
- Describe
- Explain
- Predict
- Control

This is a very scientific method while control is always the central and most powerful goal.

## The reasons why there is often a close relationship between the goals of explanation and prediction:

On the one hand, often an accurate explanation of the caused underlying some form of behaivor will allow a researcher to make accurate predictions about future behaviors.
On the other hand, different understanding of a test result and its explanation may leads to different ideas about what to predict.
